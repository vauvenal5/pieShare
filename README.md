# PieShare

## What is PieShare?

### In one word?
Private.

### No for real?
PieShare is a free tool for syncing and collaborating. It can make your documents, photos and everything else available everywhere you want without giving it to anybody you donâ€™t want to.

A normal cloud drive needs you to store your data on a remote server. You don't actually know who else has the possibility to view your documents. So you naturally won't store sensible information on such a solution.

There are also quite a few solutions out there which allow you to set up your private server at home. However not everybody has the resources or knowledge needed to set up such a server. And even worse: the ability to share your data with somebody else is quite limited when using a private server.

PieShare tackles exactly these downsides. Your data is not copied to an external server and PieShare is easy to use because you don't need anything else than the devices you already have.

So PieShare brings the benefits of both systems together: 
- It is easy to set up. 
- You are free to collaborate with others. 
- And last, but certainly most important, your data is safe.

### And the best thing? 
It's not only free to use. It's free like in freedom. So you can at all time check if we keep what we promise and how our security mechanisms are implemented.

## Some additional information.
At the moment PieShare is being developed as a Bachelor project at the Technical University of Vienna. Therefore we cannot allow anybody to collaborate directly. When the project reaches the next phase it will be open for collaboration. However feel free to submit suggestions, critiques and feature requests. Around mid summer 2014 we should be able to open the project for code collaboration.
